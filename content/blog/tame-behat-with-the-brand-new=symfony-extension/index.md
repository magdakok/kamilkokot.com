title: Tame Behat with the Brand New Symfony Extension
date: "2019-02-11"
---

Over two years after the first stable release of this library, I'm happy to announce the second version which includes:

- support for Symfony's autowiring and autoconfiguration for contexts
- simplified usage, going down from using three interconnected extensions to one
- zero-configuration for regular Symfony 3/4 applications
- unified Behat configuration and dotenv file handling (very similar to PHPUnit one)
- integration with Mink, out of the box
- improved DX with more descriptive exceptions and more predictable overall behaviour
- Symfony Flex contrib recipe to wrap it up
